# Summary
At the end of the project, we successfully created the Super Market Billing System in Java using Swing and SQLite. We have created a system where the cashier can create new orders and generate bills, and the admin can delete and add Products and New Customers as well. We also learned how we could use SQL to query the database and get the relevant data from the database. However, we can add further information, like using our system to discount a particular bill, add GST and other taxes etc.
